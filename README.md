> **"A Single-File Cyber Intelligence Dashboard for the Modern Operator."**
CYBote is an ultra-lightweight, offline-first dashboard designed to bridge the gap between **OSI Theory**, **Kali Linux Tools**, and **Port/Service knowledge**. It serves as an interactive HUD (Heads-Up Display) for students, CTF players, and cybersecurity professionals.

## 🚀 Key Features
### 1. 🌐 Semantic OSI Analyzer (Layer 1-7)
Navigate the OSI model interactively. CYBote features a **Semantic Relation Engine**:
*   Clicking **"Spoofing"** (Layer 2) won't just search for text. It intelligently fetches tools associated with **MITM, ARP, Sniffing, and DNS Poisoning**.
*   **Gap-Filled Arsenal:** Covers everything from `Minicom` (Hardware/L1) to `Wafw00f` (L7/Firewall).
### 2. 🛠️ Intelligent Kali Arsenal
A curated database of top-tier security tools, mapped to:
*   **Categories:** Information Gathering, Post-Exploitation, Forensics, etc.
*   **Tags:** Semantic tags (`#rpc`, `#smb`, `#kerberos`) allow for cross-referencing.
*   **Docs:** One-click access to official Kali documentation.
### 3. ⚡ Omni-Search Port Scanner
Instantly identify ports and services.
*   Type `22`, `ssh`, or even `encrypt` to find relevant ports.
*   Cross-links automatically with the OSI panel (e.g., searching "SMB" highlights Layer 5/7 and relevant tools like `Enum4linux`).
### 4. 🌎 Bilingual Support (i18n)
Full support for **English** and **Spanish**, switchable instantly.
*   **Smart Definitions:** The generic "Definición" button adapts its search query based on your language (`define:term +en+español` vs `define:term`).
### 5. 📦 Zero Dependencies (Single-File)
*   **No React, No Angular, No Node_modules.**
*   Just **Standard Web Technologies** (ES6+, CSS3 Variables).
*   Runs in **any browser**
